# Random Password Generator

![Screenshot of the password generator website's page](./assets/images/pwgenerator-ss.jpg)

A starting webpage was provided and styled, with the goal being to create a random password generator.
<br>This functions primarily by utilizing JavaScript.
<br>When the "Generate Password" button is clicked, a series of prompts will appear.
<br>These will determine password length as well as which types of characters will be used in the password.
<br>Once all prompts have been answered, the new password will appear inside the dotted box.
